TODO:
The trackerwalk should work now in Scene 2. Try it next time.
Edit LocomotionManager for Start/Stop
Make sure you can start any locomotion method from config
Add dt to the log, and make sure it logs all trackers for all my locomotionmethods
Make sure the animationmanager can play this as well.
